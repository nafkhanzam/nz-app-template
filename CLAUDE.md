# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Root (monorepo)
```bash
pnpm dev          # run both apps concurrently
pnpm typecheck    # typecheck all workspaces
```

### Server (`apps/server`)
```bash
pnpm dev                  # tsx watch src/main (hot reload)
pnpm build                # tsc compile
pnpm typecheck            # tsc --noEmit
pnpm generate             # regenerate ZenStack artifacts after .zmodel changes
pnpm db:push              # push schema without migration (dev only)
pnpm migrate:dev          # create + apply migration
pnpm migrate:deploy       # apply migrations in production
pnpm db:studio            # ZenStack studio UI
pnpm db:seed              # run src/scripts/seed.ts
```

### Web (`apps/web`)
```bash
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server
pnpm build        # production build
pnpm typecheck    # svelte-kit sync + svelte-check
pnpm lint         # prettier --check
pnpm format       # prettier --write
pnpm test         # Playwright e2e tests
pnpm test:ui      # Playwright UI mode
pnpm test:headed  # visible browser
```

### Local services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.services.yml up -d      # Postgres + Garage
bash scripts/garage-init.sh nz-app-template-development  # bucket, key, public reads
```
Garage replaces MinIO (community edition archived April 2026). It exposes two
ports: `3900` for signed S3 calls and `3902` for anonymous reads, where the
bucket is taken from the first label of the host.

This root `docker-compose.services.yml` is for **local dev only** (ports published,
default passwords). Production has its own separate compose files under `deploy/` —
see Deployment below.

## Architecture

Pnpm monorepo with two workspaces: `apps/server` and `apps/web`. Web imports server types directly via workspace link (`"server": "link:../server"`).

### Server (`apps/server`)

Express + tRPC + ZenStack v3 on PostgreSQL via Kysely.

- **`src/zenstack/`** — ZenStack schema files (`.zmodel`) and generated outputs (`schema.ts`, `models.ts`, `input.ts`). `core.zmodel` defines base types and core models (User, File, RefreshToken, Post). `app.zmodel` has app-specific models. **Edit `.zmodel` files, then run `pnpm generate`.** `migrations/` lives here too (not at `apps/server/migrations/`) because Prisma puts migration history next to the schema it was generated from.
- **`src/db.ts`** — `ZenStackClient` (raw, no policies) as `db`; `authDb = db.$use(new PolicyPlugin())` enforces access policies. Always use `userDb` (context-scoped, auth set) inside tRPC handlers for policy-enforced queries.
- **`src/context.ts`** — tRPC context: extracts JWT from `Authorization` header, creates `userDb = authDb.$setAuth(user)`, provides `log` (per-request logger — see Logging below).
- **`src/trpc.ts`** — `t` (public procedure), `tuser` (authenticated procedure that throws 401 if no user).
- **`src/router.ts`** — root `appRouter`; CRUD routes auto-generated via `createZenStackRouter(schema, t)` mounted at `crud`.
- **`src/main.ts`** — Express app. Routes: `/trpc` (tRPC), `/api/model` (ZenStack REST RPC), `/health/live` (process is up — Docker healthcheck), `/health/ready` (DB + object storage reachable — this is what blue-green deploy polls before switching traffic), `/health/version` (returns `{ sha, appName, appEnv }` — checked against the public domain after a deploy to confirm the switch actually happened).
- **`src/functions/`** — individual tRPC procedures (login, register, me, refresh, oidc, file-upload, change-password, etc.).
- **`src/shared/`** — code shared with web (jwt utils, upload helpers). Symlinked/imported by web at `src/lib/shared/`.

### Web (`apps/web`)

SvelteKit (static adapter) + TailwindCSS v4 + DaisyUI + TanStack Query.

- **`src/lib/client.svelte.ts`** — two API clients:
  - `trpc` / `trpc_` — tRPC client using `myFetch` (auto-refreshes token on 401) / `myFetchNoRefresh`.
  - `client` — ZenStack v3 RPC client via `useClientQueries` hitting `/api/model`.
- **`src/lib/my-fetch.svelte.ts`** — fetch wrapper that intercepts 401s, refreshes access token via `trpc_.refresh`, retries. Uses a mutex to prevent concurrent refresh races.
- **`src/lib/stores/`** — Svelte 5 rune-based stores: `token` (access JWT), `refresh` (refresh JWT), `user`, `theme`.
- **`src/routes/(core)/(app)/`** — authenticated app shell with Navbar/Footer. `(admin)` sub-group for admin-only pages.
- **`src/lib/zenstack/`** — generated ZenStack client types (do not edit manually).

### Auth flow

JWT-based dual-token (access + refresh). Access token sent as `Authorization` header (bare token, not `Bearer`). On 401, web auto-refreshes via `/trpc/refresh` mutation. ZenStack access policies use `auth()` which resolves from the token payload (no DB lookup per request).

OIDC login is **opt-in**: `env.oidc` (`apps/server/src/env-schema.ts`) is `OidcSettings | null`, non-null only when all four `OIDC_ISSUER`/`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`/`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`/`OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` env vars are set. `requireOidcSettings()` in `functions/oidc.ts` throws `PRECONDITION_FAILED` if an OIDC procedure is called while unconfigured — the app boots and runs fine with OIDC completely unset.

### Logging

`src/log.ts` — `createLog()` returns a `tslog` logger; if `LOKI_URL` is set it also ships every line to Loki. **Never pass secrets in a log payload** (tokens, passwords, full OIDC userinfo) — logs reach stdout/`docker logs` always, and Loki whenever it's configured, both wider audiences than the database. `context.ts` already masks `Authorization`/`Cookie` request headers before logging them; that pattern doesn't extend automatically to values you pass yourself, so check what you're logging by hand.

### File uploads

Presigned S3 URLs: client calls `getUploadUrl` tRPC → gets presigned PUT URL → uploads directly to S3/Garage → calls `confirmUpload` to mark `File.status = UPLOADED`.

`AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` signs uploads; `PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT` serves reads. They are different hosts and must not be swapped — a signature is bound to the host it was made for.

The S3 client sets `requestChecksumCalculation: "WHEN_REQUIRED"`. Without it the SDK signs a CRC32 it cannot compute ahead of the upload, and S3-compatible servers reject the PUT with `InvalidDigest`.

## Deployment

Production deploys are blue-green: two identical slots (`blue`/`green`), each a full
`server`+`web` pair, behind a Caddy reverse proxy. Only one slot receives traffic at a time.
Full step-by-step VPS setup is in `README.md`; this is the code map.

- **`deploy/docker-compose.app.yml`** — one slot (server+web), parameterized by `SLOT`/
  `SERVER_IMAGE`/`WEB_IMAGE` env vars. No ports published — reached only by network alias
  on the `edge` docker network.
- **`deploy/docker-compose.services.yml`** / **`docker-compose.proxy.yml`** — the persistent
  parts (Postgres, Garage, Caddy edge). Brought up once during VPS setup, not per-deploy.
- **`deploy/_common.sh`** — shared by `deploy.sh`/`rollback.sh`: derives the four domains from
  `APP_NAME`/`APP_ENV`/`BASE_DOMAIN`, reads/writes `state.json` (the single source of truth for
  which slot is live — never re-derive this by grepping the Caddyfile), polls readiness, verifies
  the public domain after a switch.
- **`deploy/deploy.sh`** — the actual deploy: reads `state.json` → picks the idle slot → detects
  whether any new migration is breaking (via `scripts/scan-migrations.ts`, comparing against the
  previously-deployed commit) → migrates → starts the new slot → health-checks it → switches Caddy
  → verifies → stops the old slot. A breaking migration takes a different, non-zero-downtime path:
  backup the DB, stop the old slot *before* migrating (they share one DB, so the old slot can't be
  left running against a schema it doesn't understand), then proceed.
- **`deploy/rollback.sh`** — flips back to the previous slot (`state.json.previous`). Refuses
  outright if the last deploy was a breaking migration — the old slot's code no longer matches the
  schema, so a pointer flip would just crash it. The message it prints points at the DB backup
  instead.
- **`scripts/scan-migrations.ts`** — classifies a `migration.sql` file as breaking (`DROP TABLE`,
  `DROP COLUMN`, `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`, `RENAME`, `ADD COLUMN ... NOT NULL` without a `DEFAULT`)
  or safe, by matching real DDL keywords (not Prisma's own `-- DropTable`-style comments, which
  render without a space and so never match).

**Known limitation, worth fixing before relying on it further:** `scripts/validate-env.ts` only
validates `apps/server/.env` against its Zod schema; `apps/web/.env` is written by the same CI/deploy
steps but never validated, so a broken `PUBLIC_*` value only surfaces at runtime in the browser.
