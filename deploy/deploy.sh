# Blue-green deploy — §4.2 of summary.md. Run from the repo root on the VPS
# (self-hosted runner checkout), after apps/server/.env and apps/web/.env
# have already been written from the decrypted secrets (see deploy.yml).
#
# Usage: deploy.sh <env> <server_digest> <web_digest> <git_sha>
#   server_digest / web_digest : ghcr.io/<owner>/<app>-{server,web}@sha256:...
#   git_sha                    : full commit SHA being deployed (baked into
#                                 the server image as GIT_SHA, used here to
#                                 diff which migration files are new)
#
# Prerequisites this script assumes already exist (Langkah 6, not this
# script's job to create): docker networks `edge`/`appnet`, a running
# `caddy-edge` container with deploy/Caddyfile mounted, deploy/docker-
# compose.services.yml (postgres+garage) up. Also needs `jq` on the VPS.
